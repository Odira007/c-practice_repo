This repository contains the creation of a unix command line interpreter that handles a s
eries of commands. The shell is a program that interacts with the user through a terminal
or takes the input of a file and executes a sequence of commands that are passed to the o
perating system. The shell is expected to work exactly like the thompson shell. The shell
 program must have the same output as sh(bin/sh), as well as the same error output.
